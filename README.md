# store-locator

Experimental project that searches for stores within a given radius using the Google Maps API and Google Places Library. 

## Getting Started

  1. Install bower dependencies 

  ```$ bower install```
  
  2. If you're using Sass and grunt, run 

  ```$ npm install```
  
  3. Open js/app.js and set the store

  ```var input = { store: '[Store Name]', ... };```
	
You can start a local web server to preview the map by running ```$ node server.js``` in the command line.
The server runs on http://localhost:8000/.
	
	
Enjoy!
